This repository contains all of the non-* software.

To build it, just type 'make'. Stuff will happen. Eventually, you'll
have to answer some build questions. Just answer them. Don't make
things harder on yourself by trying to build everything
individually. Just type 'make'. I'm serious. It's that simple.
