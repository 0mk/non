This repository contains all of the non-* software.

If you don't have NTK packages installed (which isn't very likely yet)
you *MUST* begin by typing:

    make ntk

Then, to build everything else, just type 'make'. Stuff will
happen. Eventually, you'll have to answer some build questions. Just
answer them. Don't make things harder on yourself by trying to build
everything individually. Just type 'make'. I'm serious. It's that
simple.
