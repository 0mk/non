This repository contains all of the non-* software.

If you don't have NTK packages installed (which isn't very likely yet)
you *MUST* begin by typing:

    make ntk

Then, run './configure' (use the '-i' option if you want to interactively
configure) Then, to build everything else, just type 'make'. Stuff will happen.
Don't make things harder on yourself by trying to build everything individually. Just
type 'make'. I'm serious. It's that simple.
