<h1 id="u:1.">Description</h1>
<p>
The Non Sequencer is a powerful real-time, pattern-based MIDI sequencer for Linux--released under the GPL.  Filling the void left by countless DAWs, piano-roll editors, and other purely performance based solutions, it is a compositional tool--one that transforms MIDI music-making on Linux from a complex nightmare into a pleasurable, efficient, and streamlined process.
</p>
<p>
Please see the <a class=ext href="MANUAL.html">manual</a> for more information.
</p>
<h1 id="u:2.">What it is not</h1>
<p>
Non is <b>not</b> a plain MIDI recorder, tracker, software synthesizer, notation editor or AI system. There are other programs available to do those things. Non is intended to be one tool among many in your Linux audio toolbox.
</p>
<p>
Everything in Non happens <i>on-line</i>, in realtime. Music is composed live, while the transport is running.
</p>
<h1 id="u:3.">What does freedom have to do with this software?</h1>
<p>
Non is <i>free software</i>. This means, briefly, that you are free use it as <b>you</b> wish, free to examine and adapt the source code, free to share it with your friends, and free to publish your changes to the source code. Furthermore, Non is <i>copyleft</i>, which means that you are free from the threat of some other entity taking over and denying you the above freedoms. The <i>free</i> part of <i>free software</i> doesn't refer to price any more than the <i>free</i> in <i>free speech</i> does.
</p>

<h1 id="u:4.">Donations</h1>
<p>
Donations can take many forms. You can donate your time in code, either by sending it to me for review or cloning the git repository and publishing one containing your changes. You can donate your time in testing, documentation, artwork, indexing, etc. Or, if you don't feel that you possess the time or skills required for the above forms of donation, you can donate money instead. Money donated will help to ensure that I have the free time, good nutrition and enthusiasm required to implement new features.  It can also be a more palpable way of saying "Thanks for caring." or "Job well done!"
</p>
<p>
If you don't love this software, don't feel guilty about not contributing. If you do love it, then please help me improve it--in whatever manner you think is appropriate.
